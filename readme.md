# Preact Starter

This is my attempt at a bare bones dev environment for `preact`

## Modules
* `webpack` for serving pages
* `babel` for compiling jsx
* `eslint` with `standard` and `react` for keeping code consistent

## Gotchas
* Fix `.babelrc` to recognize the `h` as the rendering function
* Fix `.eslintrc` to not complain about `h` as being undefined
